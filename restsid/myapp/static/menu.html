        :>Sambar
        Our Sambar is a traditional South Indian lentil stew made with slow-cooked toor dal, fresh seasonal vegetables, and a perfect blend of aromatic spices. Simmered to perfection and finished with a flavorful tempering, it delivers a comforting balance of spice, tang, and warmth.
        Served hot and fresh, our sambar pairs beautifully with idli, dosa, vada, rice, and other South Indian favorites - a true taste of home in every spoon.
